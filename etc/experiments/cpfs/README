Experimental simple and reliable FS code, not so connected to Phantom OS

Bugs

- mutex init is missing now and there

Questions:

- max disk size
- max file size
- have atime, ctime, mtime?
- time variable format/unit/0 time?

- max num of concurrent io ops

- open/create timing depends on max file count in dir

TODO
- mark each func with max disk r/w ops count and max execution time on target CPU

- disk struct align - check field order and use GCC attributes?

- sb lock to return ptr to sb, no global var

- fsck
- multiple fs (fs struct and param)
- r/w errors, not panic

- subdirs

- inode complete free/alloc code
