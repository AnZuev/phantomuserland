Refactoring of old Phantom compiler and Java to Phantom convertor


Java to Phantom convertor
-------------------------

based on Soot framework as .class file parser and Phantom language compiler's
codegen as output. Mostly - mapping from soot output to phantom code 
internal representation (tree).

NB. Direct access to class field in java is not supported in Phantom. Generate getters?
