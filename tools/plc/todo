
- non-public classes, more than one class in src file, compile used class before one that uses it
- seems like we have code for "new int" instead of "new int[]" - see test.toPhantom.ArraySimple1.lstc 
- java constructors and <init> - replace <init> with call to root constructor?
- generate <init>? at fixed ordinal?
- not converted to Phantom types ".byte" and ".short" types exist
